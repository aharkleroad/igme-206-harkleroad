1. First create class Car to construct car objects
    Principle functions of Car should include:
        A Car constructor that determines the road the car is travelling on
        Get the road the car is driving on
        Get the car's arrival time
        Get the direction the car will turn
        Set the car's arrival time
        Set the time it takes the car to pass through the intersection

2. Then create the EventManager class that extends Comparable to hold Events
    Principle functions of EventManager should include:
        An EventManager constructor
        Add generic objects to the manager chronologically
        Return an object at a given index in the manager
        Remove an object from the manager at a given index

3. Then create the class Events that implements Comparable to create event objects
    Principle functions of Event should include:
        Create an Events object that sets the event type, associates it with a car, and sets the time it occurs
        Create an Events object that sets the event type and the time it occurs
        Get the time an event occurs
        Get the type of event
        Compare the time two events occur

4. Finally create the Driver class to implement the event-based sim
    Principle functions of Driver should include:
        Create the time clock
        Create the tracker for the EW cars, the NS cars, and the total cars that enter the intersection
        Create two variables to hold the sum total of the cars on the EW road and NS road
        Create a variable to count the number of times an event is dealt with
        Create the wait time trackers
        Create three variables to track if the EW light is green, the NS light is green, and/or the NS arrow is green
        Create a variable to track if there is a EW car in the intersection
        Create a variable to track if there is a NS car in the intersection
        Create an ArrayList that holds the cars waiting on the EW road
        Create a variable to save the number of cars on the EW road
        Create an ArrayList that holds the cars waiting on the NS road
        Create a variable to save the number of cars on the NS road
        Create an EventManager object
        Create the shutdown event
        Add the shutdown event to the EventManager
        Create an event to start the light cycle at the beginning of the sim
        Add the event to the EventManager
        Determine the time the first car arrives
        Create an arrival event for the first car
        Add the arrival event to the EventManager
        Create an Events object to save the current event and set it equal to the first event in the EventManager
        While the current event is not the shutdown event
            Determine the time that has passed since the last event
            Determine the number of cars on the EW road
            Add the number of cars on the EW road to the running total
            Add the sum of the time every car in line waited to the total wait time trackers and EW wait time trackers
            Determine the number of cars going north on the NS road
            Add the number of cars on the NS road to the running total
            Add the sum of the time every car in line waited to the total wait time trackers and NS wait time trackers
            Set the clock time to the time of the current event
            Create a switch based on event type
                In event type 1 (a car arrives at the intersection)
                    Increase the number of cars that have arrived
                    If the car is on the EW road
                        Add the car to the EW queue
                        Set the arrival time of that car
                        If the EW light is green, there is exactly 1 car in the queue, and there isn't a EW car in the intersection
                            Create a new event for the car to enter the intersection and add it to the manager
                    Otherwise
                        Add the car to the NS queue
                        Set the arrival time of that car
                        If the NS light is green, there is exactly 1 car in the queue, and there isn't a NS car in the intersection
                            Create a new event for the car to enter the intersection and add it to the manager
                    Generate the arrival time of the next car
