/**
 * 1. READ the ENTIRE exam write-up PDF document before starting! 
 * 
 * 2. Your instructor will not be available for questions!
 *       - If something is unclear, document any assumptions you make clearly 
 *         in the comments in your program.
 *       
 * 3. SAVE OFTEN!  
 *       - Any computer can crash.  You are responsible for saving your code.
 *       - Make your you COMMIT and PUSH to your GitHub repo before making
 *         the final release!
 *       
 * 4. Look over the grading rubric for specifics on how this practical will be graded!
 *       - Be strategic about how you spend your time! 
 *       - TEST as you go!
 * 
 * 5. Your program must compile and run without errors to get full credit.  
 *       - Comment out (but do not delete!) anything that doesn’t compile, crashes, or 
 *         otherwise prevents demonstration of features that you have working.
