## How to use this

Normally your Unity project will be set up something like this:

```
root-folder/
|
|---Assets/
|---Library/
|---Packages/
|---ProjectSettings/
|...
```

To set up the .gitignore included here, make sure its saved inside that root folder and at the same level as the Assets and Library directories.


This is also where you should initiate you Git repository.
